# UIO-User-Interface-Organizer
An NVSE-powered plugin that is designed to manage and maintain all UI/HUD extensions added to the game by various mods.
UIO will ensure UI extensions are always properly installed and, when necessary, properly removed; it will automatically detect, resolve and prevent UI-related issues, and will help keep the game's UI intact.
